### Description:

Well met with Fibonacci bigger brother, AKA Tribonacci.

As the name may already reveal, it works basically like a Fibonacci, but summing the last 3 (instead of 2) numbers of the sequence to generate the next. And, worse part of it, regrettably I won't get to hear non-native Italian speakers trying to pronounce it :(

So, if we are to start our Tribonacci sequence with [1, 1, 1] as a starting input (AKA signature), we have this sequence:

[1, 1 ,1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, ...]
But what if we started with [0, 0, 1] as a signature? As starting with [0, 1] instead of [1, 1] basically shifts the common Fibonacci sequence by once place, you may be tempted to think that we would get the same sequence shifted by 2 places, but that is not the case and we would get:

[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, ...]
Well, you may have guessed it by now, but to be clear: you need to create a fibonacci function that given a signature array/list, returns the first n elements - signature included of the so seeded sequence.

Signature will always contain 3 numbers; n will always be a non-negative number; if n == 0, then return an empty array (except in C return NULL) and be ready for anything else which is not clearly specified ;)

### Solutions

#### C 

```C
#include <stdlib.h>

long long *tribonacci(const long long signature[3], size_t n) {
    if (n == 0) return NULL;
    long long *sequence = malloc(n * sizeof(long long));
    for (size_t i = 0; i < 3 && i < n; i++) sequence[i] = signature[i];
    for (size_t i = 3; i < n; i++) sequence[i] = sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2] + sequence[i-3];
    return sequence;
}
```

```C
#include <stddef.h>

long long *tribonacci(const long long *a, size_t n) {
  if (!n) return NULL;
  long long *r = (long long *)calloc(n, sizeof(long long));
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) r[i] = i < 3 ? a[i] : r[i-3] + r[i-2] + r[i-1];
  return r;
}
```

```JS
function tribonacci(signature,n){
  let seed = [...signature]
  
  while(seed.length < n){
    let l = seed.length-1
    let next = seed[l]+seed[l-1]+seed[l-2]
    seed.push(next)
  }
  
  return seed.slice(0,n)
  
}
```
