### Description:

Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.

There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.

\#Fundamentals

### Examples (input --> output):

```
[7] should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[0] should return 0, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[1,1,2] should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[0,1,0,1,0] should return 0, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd).
[1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1] should return 4, because it appears 1 time (which is odd).
```

### Solutions

#### C 

```C
#include <stddef.h>

int find_odd(size_t length, const int array[length]) {
    int result = 0;

    for (size_t i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        result ^= array[i];
    }

    return result;
}
```

```C
#include <stddef.h>

int find_odd (size_t length, const int array[length])
{
  int v=0;
  int*p=array;
  while(length--)v^=*p++;
  return v;
}
```
