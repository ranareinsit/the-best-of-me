### Description:

In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

\#Fundamental

### Examples (input --> output):

```
makeNegative(1);  // return -1
makeNegative(-5); // return -5
makeNegative(0);  // return 0
```

### Solutions

#### C 

```C
int makeNegative(int num) {
    return num > 0 ? -num : num;
}

```

```C
int makeNegative(int num)
{
  return -abs(num);
}
```

```C
int makeNegative(int num)
{
  if (num <= 0) return num;
  return (~num)+1;
}
```

```C
int makeNegative()
{
    int num = makeNegative;
    __asm__("movl %%edi, %0":"=r"(num               ):             :)
    ;if (num & 1 << 31);                            else
      __asm__("negl %0":"=r"(num):"r"(num)          :)
      ;return num;
}
```

```C
const double makeNegative = -3355216631615787520;
/*
The solution and test code are in separate compilation units. So the type of makeNegative in the solution does not matter for a successful compilation. The only requirement is that something called makeNegative is in the compiled solution and makeNegative is executable. Constants are placed in the executable memory by clang. The makeNegative constant contains machine codes corresponding to the following assembly program:

mov eax, edi    ; 89 f8
neg edi         ; f7 df
cmovs eax, edi  ; 0f 48 c7
ret             ; c3

(The input argument is in edi and the result is returned in eax.)
